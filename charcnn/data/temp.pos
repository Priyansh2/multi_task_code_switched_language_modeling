Sample project proposals from last year can now be downloaded from the "resource" section.
NOTE! Last year, proposals were up to 2 pages, not up to 4 pages, and didn't have to include preliminary results. The scope of the proposals you submit should exceed those of the sample proposals.
The 11 proposals uploaded match the 11 final projects that were uploaded. So if you want, you can compare the proposals and final reports and see how they evolved.
